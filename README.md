# Docker IoT Machine

This Docker configuration creates an IoT Raspberry Pi device as a foundation for IoT development in our makerspace. Before using Docker, we configured our devices the hard way - see our original configuration here: [IoT Raspberry Pi Device](https://raspberry-valley.azurewebsites.net/IoT-Raspberry-Pi-Device/). The same can be achieved using [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which is achieved in this project.

We are a maker community in Karlskrona, Sweden. See our site for other ideas and activities: [Raspberry Valley](https://raspberry-valley.azurewebsites.net).
